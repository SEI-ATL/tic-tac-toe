# Tic Tac Toe

## Objectives

* Build a tic tac toe game in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
* Use best practices when writing code

This week we have been learning about HTML/CSS, Javascript and DOM manipulations, and writing functions.

We will be making a Tic Tac Toe game using all of these concepts.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository. <!-- Done -->
* Before you even start working with JavaScript, construct the gameboard. The gameboard page should include the 3x3 grid (of divs). Using `id` and `class` on clickable elements will help you wire this up in JavaScript afterwards. <!-- Done -->
* The JavaScript portion will be next <!-- Done -->
  * Select elements and attach functions via event listeners <!-- Done -->
  * You will also need a variable to keep track of moves. This will be used to indicate whether or not to draw an `X` or an `O` <!-- Done -->

## Requirements
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move. <!-- Done -->
* Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O` <!-- Done -->
* Upon marking of an individual cell, use JavaScript to add a class to each cell to display the separate players. <!-- Done -->
* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played. <!-- Done -->
* Detect draw conditions (ties/cat's game) 
* Detect winner: Stop game and declare the winner if one player ends up getting three in a row. <!-- Done --> 
  * Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move. <!-- Done -->

**Have Fun** - The best way to learn is by playing with code. Let creativity guide you and try some experiments with JS and CSS and see what you can do.

## Bonuses

* Implement your reset button without refreshing the whole page <!-- Done -->
* Track player's wins over time
* Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
* Make your computer seem more human by adding a short time delay between your turn and the computer's turn.
* Style it up! Get creative, or even make a theme!

## Super Duper Bonus

* Add an AI that can beat you every time with the mini-max algorithm.
